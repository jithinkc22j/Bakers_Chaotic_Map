The baker's map is a chaotic map from the unit square into itself.

The folded baker's map is a two-dimensional analog of the tent map.The baker's map preserves the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The map is strong mixing and it is topologically mixing.

          Functions:
               Main function                  - main.m
               Bakers map function x-values   - bakersx.m
               Bakers map function y-values   - bakersy.m (Optional - If you need  y values
Input the value to x and y;

                x=  ; % Initial values
                y=  ; % Initial values
